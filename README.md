## Overview
Acorn was created as a lightweight snippet management tool for saving, editing, and re-using snippets of text across any necessary application. Designed to always be running in the background and be easily accessible through a user defined hotkey.
**ALT + SHIFT + P** is the starting default hotkey.

## Features
- Quickly access the application at any time from the keyboard hotkey.
- Save snippets by Type which creates a new button at the top to house all the snippets that are related.
  - Copy your saved snippets directly to the clipboard.
  - Edit and Delete your snippets easily!
- Add file extension types to the snippets for future enhancements (such as snippet downloads, editing in applications like Visual Studio Code, or Syntax highlighting).
- Add descriptions to your snippets so you have a quick idea of what they are for.
- Hover over the snippets to see a sample of the text inside.
- Configure the hotkeys from the system tray menu.
- Allows for multiple themes (work in progress).
- Search your snippets to quickly find what you need.
- Future updates are automatically shown on the interface for users to update when they're ready.
